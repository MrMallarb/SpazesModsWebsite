<p>Meet these friendly (and goofy ah ah) creatures! These creatures reside in Mangrove Swamps and loves slimeballs! These creatures are akin to Toads and will play around them! When they see something as an enemy, they use their tongue to stun and stomp them down!</p>
<p>They can trade potions that help you, such as speed potions, jump potions, instant health potions, and regeneration!</p>
